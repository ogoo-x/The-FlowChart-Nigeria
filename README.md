FlowChart: Mapping Period Poverty in Nigeria

Empowering Data for a Period Poverty-Free Nigeria

FlowChart is a pioneering social impact project dedicated to revolutionizing the fight against period poverty in Nigeria. Our core mission is to provide a data-driven, interactive platform that visualizes the burden of period poverty across the nation and highlights existing interventions, empowering individuals, NGOs, and the government to direct resources where they're needed most.
The Challenge: Period Poverty in Nigeria

Millions of women and girls in Nigeria face significant challenges accessing menstrual health products, proper hygiene facilities, and vital education. This pervasive issue, known as period poverty, has profound negative impacts on health, education, economic opportunities, and overall well-being. Without clear data on where the need is greatest, interventions often lack precision and maximum impact.
Our Solution: The FlowChart Web Application

FlowChart is building a powerful web application featuring a detailed interactive choropleth map of Nigeria. This map will serve as a central hub for understanding and addressing period poverty:

    Burden Visualization: The map will visually display the prevalence and severity of period poverty across all towns and local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria, using clear, color-coded indicators.

    Intervention Layer: A unique overlay will showcase various menstrual health interventions already active in specific areas, allowing for better coordination and identification of gaps.

    Data-Driven Insights: By bringing this critical data to light, FlowChart will enable NGOs, individuals, and government bodies to make informed, data-driven decisions, ensuring resources are directed to areas with the highest burden.

    Awareness & Progress Tracking: The platform will significantly increase public awareness of period poverty and serve as a crucial tool for tracking Nigeria's progress towards its eradication.

Key Features

    Interactive Choropleth Map: Explore period poverty data down to the town level.

    Intervention Overlay: See where efforts are already making a difference.

    User-Friendly Interface: Designed for easy navigation and understanding by all stakeholders.

    Static Data Integration: Currently, data is statically integrated for immediate visualization and awareness.

Technology Stack

FlowChart's web application is primarily built with modern frontend technologies to ensure a responsive and engaging user experience:

    React.js: For building a dynamic and component-based user interface.

    Recharts: For creating compelling data visualizations, including our custom bar charts and future stacked area charts.

    Framer Motion: To bring the data to life with smooth, engaging animations as users scroll and interact.

    KoboCollect: Our chosen tool for efficient and offline-capable data collection in the field.

    GitHub Pages: For reliable and accessible web hosting.

How It Works (Our Data Pipeline)

    Data Collection: We gather primary data through surveys conducted in selected LGAs across Nigeria, leveraging tools like KoboCollect.

    Data Processing: Collected data is cleaned, validated, and prepared for visualization.

    Visualization: The processed data is then fed into our React application to power the interactive map and various charts.

Our Impact

FlowChart is designed to create tangible change through several key impact areas:

    Create Awareness: By making the invisible visible, we aim to spark conversations and educate the public about the realities of period poverty.

    Direct Interventions: Our map provides actionable insights, guiding NGOs, government bodies, and individuals to deploy resources and initiatives precisely where they are most needed.

    Promote Collaboration: We foster a platform for stakeholders to identify gaps, coordinate efforts, and build stronger partnerships in the menstrual health sector.

    Track Progress: FlowChart serves as a national barometer, allowing us to monitor the effectiveness of interventions and celebrate collective progress over time.
